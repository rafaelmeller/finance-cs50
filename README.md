## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
C$50 Finance is a web application built using Flask  that allows users to simulate stock trading. Users can register and log in with a unique username and password. The app fetches current stock prices and enables users to buy, sell, or hold stocks. It maintains a transaction history for each user, tracking their portfolio and updating it based on real-time stock price changes. Additionally, users can add more money to their account and change their passwords. The application was originally built using an API endpoint that provided CSV data, which is no longer available. Because of that, it has been adjusted to use a new API endpoint that returns JSON data. 

## Features üåü

## Application Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The backend is designed using Flask and SQLite. The main modules include:
- `app.py`: Contains the main application routes and logic.
- `helpers.py`: Contains helper functions for the application, including the `lookup` function to query stock prices.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering the web pages. It uses a layout template and Jinja to dynamically generate the content.
- `static/`: Contains static files like CSS for styling.

### Data Flow
1. **User Registration/Login**: Users can register and log in to the application.
2. **Stock Transactions**: Users can buy and sell stocks. The application queries the Yahoo Finance API to get the latest stock prices.
3. **Portfolio Management**: Users can view their portfolio, including the current value of their stocks and transaction history.
4. **Database**: All user data, transactions, and stock information are stored in an SQLite database.
